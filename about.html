		<h2>About Me &amp; Darth Deuces Photography</h2>

		<p>
			Welcome to Darth Deuces Photography! My name is Chris AKA Darth Deuces, as I'm known
			on other media websites. I'm a big geek, and a fan of multiple different franchises. I'm also a collector
			of mainly action figures. About two years ago I discovered the art of toy photography on Instagram. since then, I've
			been an active toy photographer, expressing my love for these franchises and toys through my photographs. I'm mainly a fan of
			Star Wars, Marvel, Transformers, and DC, but I also really like franchises such as Halo and Spawn. This website is to give myself
			a personal space in which to share my work, that is connected yet seperate to my Instagram page. I also have prints avaiable for purchase,
			as well as commission services available. More information on that can be found <a href="services.html">here</a>. I love to take toy photos 
			and I love to share my photos with the collector and geek community. I still have much to learn, and I always welcome feedback. Thanks for stopping by,
			and most importantly, enjoy!
