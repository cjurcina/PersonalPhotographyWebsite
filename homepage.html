		<h2>Welcome to Darth Deuces Photography!</h2>

		<p>
			Welcome to my website, Darth Deuces Photography! I am Darth Deuces, and this website
			is here to allow me to have a personal space all to myself to share and promote my work.
			I am a huge geek, and my hope is that you'll find something here that you will enjoy. Photography
			is a lot of fun, and I love all the franchises in which I base my photography around. That being said,
			please enjoy my work!
